# 🌾 **Village & Villager Expansion — Mod Concept**

### Overview

A full-scale reimagining of Minecraft’s village ecosystem — turning simple settlements into **living, evolving communities**.
Players can shape village growth, forge alliances, manage economies, and protect their people from evolving threats.

### Core Pillars

1. **Dynamic Villages:** Procedural variety and visual identity.
2. **Smarter Villagers:** Personalities, goals, and relationships.
3. **Interactive Systems:** Trade, reputation, quests, and economy.
4. **Emergent Progression:** Villages evolve through player interaction.
5. **Data-Driven Architecture:** JSON-based configuration for full customizability.

## 🧩 **Development Roadmap (Integration Phases)**

### **Phase 1 — Core Foundations**

**Goal:** Establish world generation, villager basics, and modular architecture.

- Village generation overhaul with biome‑tailored templates.
- Base villager AI framework with routines, memory, and needs.
- Add 3–4 new professions (Hunter, Brewer, Scribe, Engineer).
- JSON registry system for professions, trades, and structures.
- Fabric API data integration (block/entity tags, loot tables, dynamic trades).

### **Phase 2 — Systems Integration**

**Goal:** Connect gameplay loops like trade economy and reputation.

- Village economy and treasury mechanics with data persistence.
- Player reputation and influence tiers affecting trades and quest access.
- Basic defense system with guards and improved raids.
- Village manager block + admin UI for monitoring and debugging.

### **Phase 3 — Expansion & Story Layer**

**Goal:** Deepen immersion through quests, NPC stories, and player agency.

- Procedural quest generation (JSON-driven templates).
- Long-term story arcs: diplomacy, bandit wars, seasonal events.
- Village customization and management menus.
- Dynamic seasonal festivals and environmental adaptation.

### **Phase 4 — World Simulation Integration**

**Goal:** Connect with world and server-level systems.

- Multi-village diplomacy and world economy chunk system.
- Traveling caravans and cross-village trade routes.
- Event hooks for weather, calendar, and dimension-based rules.
- Configurable dynamic difficulty (raids, population, economy sync).

### **Phase 5 — Polishing & Optimization**

**Goal:** Final balancing, performance tuning, and mod compatibility.

- Async AI tick scheduling and configurable update cycles.
- Compatibility layer for Fabric API + popular structure mods.
- Mod Menu UI integration and in-game configuration editor.
- Extensive testing, translation keys, and documentation.

## 🏘️ **1. Village Generation Enhancements**

**New Village Types**

- **Frontier Villages:** Remote outposts with hunters and fortified camps.
- **Harbor Villages:** Fishing ports with boats and trading docks.
- **Mountain Monasteries:** Spiritual hubs with shrines and libraries.
- **Forest Enclaves:** Treehouse communities built among canopies.
- **Nomad Camps:** Movable settlements that relocate periodically.

**Structural Upgrades**

- Multi-story dwellings, communal areas, economic zones.
- Adaptive growth: paths and walls expand based on population.
- Upgradable landmarks (wells, totems, fountains) as progress milestones.
- Village Core / Manager block controls building progression via AI labor.

## 🤖 **2. Villager Behavior Overhaul**

**AI Features**

- Persistent memory: villagers remember player actions and events.
- Social relationships: families, friendships, rivalries.
- Routines: day/night schedules, shelter seeking, and group events.
- Contextual emotes and responses (e.g., panic during raids, joy after feasts).

**Life Simulation**

- Sleep/work cycles, chores, professions, and celebrations.
- Seasonal routines — harvests, migration, and feasts.

---

## 🧱 **3. New & Progressing Professions**

**Advanced Roles**

- Hunter, Engineer, Brewer, Scribe, Chef, Guard Captain.

**Career Growth**

- Level-based advancement with tiered tools, perks, and visual indicators.
- Unlocks unique trades, recipes, and collaborative projects.

---

## 💰 **4. Village Economy System**

**Dynamic Market**

- Supply–demand-driven pricing and scarcity-based trade shifts.
- Villager-to-villager commerce, not just player trading.

**Village Treasury**

- Shared resource pool funds defenses, upgrades, and public works.
- Player cooperation yields rewards and reputation boosts.

**Player-Owned Shops**

- Build rentable stalls or hire NPCs to sell products autonomously.

---

## ⚔️ **5. Village Defense & Threats**

**Enhanced Raids**

- Multi-phase invasions with pillager captains, siege engines, and strategic AI.
- Progressive difficulty scaling based on village prosperity.

**Defensive Evolution**

- Guard towers, alarm bells, reinforced gates, and patrol zones.
- Defense AI overseen by the **Guard Captain** profession.

**Additional Threats**

- Bandit factions establishing nearby camps.
- Occasional monster or magical incursions tied to lore events.

---

## 👑 **6. Player Reputation & Influence**

**Reputation Ladder**

- Outcast → Stranger → Friend → Ally → Champion → Honorary Villager.

**Positive Actions**

- Training guards, donating resources, completing community projects.

**Negative Actions**

- Theft, destruction, villager harm, neglect of defense duties.

Reputation dynamically alters trade prices, dialogue tone, and mission availability.

---

## 📜 **7. Quests & Story Systems**

**Quest Archetypes**

- Delivery, crafting, escort, hunt, bounty, construction.

**Story Arcs**

- Village founding tales, ruin discoveries, diplomacy, and seasonal epics.
- Quest templates modularized for JSON creation and custom additions.

---

## ⚙️ **8. Village Customization Tools**

**Village Management Menu**

- Assign jobs, approve expansions, oversee treasury, and set priorities.
- Visual indicators for happiness, productivity, and morale.

**Village Themes**

## 🧠 **9. Villager Personality System**

Each villager has:

- Name, lineage, traits (brave, greedy, kind), and evolving goals.

- Dynamic dialogue reflecting relationships and village status.

---

## 🧰 **10. Configurable Settings (Mod Menu)**

**Gameplay**

- Enable/disable subsystems (AI, professions, events).

**Difficulty**

- Controls for survival realism (mortality, resource strain, raid frequency).

**Performance**

- Villager AI tick cycles, population caps, structure density.

**Customization**

- Growth speed, trade balance, personality variety, hardcore simulation mode.

---

### Integration Vision

By Phase 5, the mod should function as a **modular RPG‑simulation layer** sitting between Minecraft’s vanilla village system and broader world generation mods.
Every feature is **data‑defined**, **synchronized across server clients**, and **extensible through JSON or datapack interfaces** — letting other mods patch into events, trade tables, and AI goals seamlessly.
